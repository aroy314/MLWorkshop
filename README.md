# MLWorkshop
Welcome to the Global Azure Bootcamp workshop about Machine Learning and Azure ML Studio, inspired from the [Microsoft Imagine Workshops](https://github.com/MSFTImagine/computerscience/tree/master/Workshop)

## Objectives
In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to:

- Build, train, and score a model using the Azure Machine Learning Studio
- Deploy your model as a Web service so it can be accessed from code or scripts
- Call an ML Web service from the apps that you write

## Instructions
The workshop can be done with a UWP app (requires Visual Studio 2015 Community edition or higher with Windows 10 SDK installed) or with a NodeJS application.
You need for both a Microsoft Azure subscription. [Sign up for a free trial](http://aka.ms/WATK-FreeTrial)
